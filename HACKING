============
Development
============

If you wish to hack the GnuCOBOL C++ source code, proceed as follows. The
following extra packages need to be installed with versions equal or greater.

If you build from VCS the tools in the first 4 lists are always needed.

For running build_aux/bootstrap (necessary after VCS checkout) / reconfigure:
  o autoconf 2.64
  o automake 1.10.1
  o libtool 2.2.6
  o m4 1.4.12

If you modify top-level configure.ac or Makefile.am in any directory then
you will need to run "autoreconf -I m4" to regenerate the necessary files.

If you want to update to a newer automake/libtool version or get errors
about wrong version numbers in m4 run "autoreconf -vfi -I m4" instead.

For compiling (when changing flex/bison sources):
  o Bison 2.3
  o Flex 2.5.35

For generating the testsuite (when changing any .at files):
  o autoconf 2.64

For generating the translation files (when changing any msgid):
  o gettext 0.17
    ** NOTE **
    If you don't need an up-to-date translation you can do 
    `touch po/*.pot po/*.po po/*.gmo` instead.

For generating the documentation (necessary for preparing a distribution):
  o help2man 0.17
    ** NOTE **
    If you don't need an up-to-date manpage you can do 
    `touch cobc/cobc.1 bin/cobcrun.1` instead.
  o texinfo 4.12 (with texinfo-tex)
  o texlive (latest, texlive-collection-latex suffices)
    ** NOTE **
    If you don't need an up-to-date info source / manual you can do
    `touch doc/gnucobol.info doc/gnucobol.pdf` instead.

For preparing a distribution do the following steps:
  ./configure           # check that the current environment is ok and
                        # generate Makefiles for distclean
  make distclean        # only needed if it isn't a direct VCS checkout
                        # --> start with a clean directory
  ./configure && make   # build, needed for re-generating bison/flex sources
                        # and for generating the texi-includes later
  po/update_linguas.sh  # get latest translations
  make distcheck        # generate a distribution tarball and check
                        # that it will work in a VPATH environment
                        # including make targets uninstall, distclean and dist
