============
Development
============

If you wish to hack the GnuCOBOL source code, proceed as follows. The
following extra packages need to be installed with versions equal or greater.

If you build from VCS the tools in the first 4 lists are always needed.

For running "autogen.sh" (necessary after VCS checkout) / reconfigure:
  o autoconf 2.70
  o automake 1.16
  o libtool 2.2.6 (2.5.3 highly+ suggested, can be easily installed locally)
  o m4 1.4.12

If you modify top-level configure.ac or Makefile.am in any directory and rerun
"make", the build system will regenerate the necessary files.

If you want to update to a different automake/libtool version or get errors
about wrong version numbers in m4 run "autogen.sh install" instead.

For compiling (when changing pparser/scanner sources):
  o Bison 2.3     (will be changed to 3.6 with GnuCOBOL 4)
  o Flex 2.5.35

For generating the testsuite (when changing any .at files):
  o autoconf 2.64

For generating the translation files (when changing any msgid):
  o gettext 0.17
    ** NOTE **
    If you don't need an up-to-date translation you can do
    "touch po/*.pot po/*.po po/*.gmo" instead.

For generating the documentation (necessary for preparing a distribution):
  o help2man 0.17
    ** NOTE **
    If you don't need an up-to-date manpage you can do
    "touch cobc/cobc.1 bin/cobcrun.1" instead.
  o texinfo 6.1 (with texinfo-tex)
  o texlive (latest, texlive-collection-latex suffices)
    ** NOTE **
    If you don't need an up-to-date info source / manual you can do
    "touch doc/gnucobol.info doc/gnucobol.pdf" instead.

For preparing a distribution do the following steps:
  ./configure           # check that the current environment is ok and
                        # generate Makefiles for distclean
  make distclean        # only needed if it isn't a direct VCS checkout
                        # --> start with a clean directory
  ./configure && make   # build, needed for re-generating bison/flex sources
                        # and for generating the texi-includes later
  po/update_linguas.sh  # get latest translations
  make distcheck        # generate a distribution tarball and check
                        # that it will work in a VPATH environment
                        # including make targets uninstall, distclean and dist

Most often there is a minimal supported version (for example GnuCOBOL 3.x
should work with GnuCOBOL versions back to 2.2); the easiest way to test
that is to first have the old version installed installed or build locally,
then do a manual run of hand-picked "special" tests from the version to test,
for example:

  make check TESTSUITEFLAGS="--debug -k exception-location -k trace"

which keeps the test sources because of "--debug".

Then do for each test you're interested in the following:
 pushd tests/testsuite.dir/NNNN  # go into the test directory
 ./run                           # re-execute the test verbose with
                                 # the version under test
 cobc --debug XXXXX              # execute all of the compile commands
                                 # with the old active environment
OR                               # if you want to compare with an
                                 # uninstalled version:
 /some/path/pre-inst-env cobc --debug XXXXX
 ../../../pre-inst-env prog      # execute the old-compiled programs
                                 # with the version under test
 popd                            # back to root...
 
And when running compare the output to the one seen when executing ./run.

For an unspecific test that does not check any of the "newer" features or
extensions the NIST suite can be compiled with that "old active" environment
while being executed with the version under test.

 cd tests/cobol85
 make test-local-compat -j6      # compile with the old active environment
                                 # but run with the new version under test
OR                               # if you want to compare with an
                                 # uninstalled version:
 make test-local-compat COBC="/some/path/pre-inst-env cobc"

There should be no difference shown as long as the "old version" passed
the same tests as the new version - given the example above: there was
no support for REPORT WRITER in 2.2 so there would be an expected failure
of the RW tests.

For debugging the AST, you may specify --enable-dump-ast at the
configure step.  In such a case, new options -fdump-ast=<file> and
-fdump-ast-flags=<flags> will become available to print the AST
generated for a given file in a file. This option is implemented using
an automatically generated printer cobc/dump_ast_gen.c, that is
generated by ctypes-gen (https://github.com/OCamlPro/ctypes-gen). If
you don't have the tool, you may just modify the file and wait for
somebody else to regenerate it at some point.
