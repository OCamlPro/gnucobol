	* Makefile.am, cobc.c, dump_ast.c: new options to dump the AST in
	text format: --dump-ast=<file>, and
	--dump-ast-flags=<flags>. Format is not standard for now, because
	it is only for debugging the AST. Flags are prefixed with '+/-'
	for enable/disable, 'i' for indentation, 'z' for zero/null
	fields. Env variables COB_DUMP_AST and COB_DUMP_AST_FLAGS can also
	be used to set these flags.
