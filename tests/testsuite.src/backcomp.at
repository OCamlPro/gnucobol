### GnuCOBOL Test Suite for backward compatibility
##
## Tests in this file are used to check that the C code coming from COBOL
## programs compiled with previous versions of GnuCOBOL are still executed
## correctly with newer versions of the compiler.
## It is useful when implementing new features in order to prevent the loss of
## compatibility with programs compiled with previous versions.
##
## To add new tests,
## 1. Choose a COBOL program;
## 2. Compile it with GnuCOBOL 4.0 (minimal compatibility ensured) and the
##    flags -Cx and -fno-computed-goto (to generated more portable C code).
##    Additional flags may be added if needed.
##    - If it does not work for compatibility reasons (unsupported feature),
##      return to step 2 with the next version of the compiler;
##    - If it does not work because of some unrecognized or conflicting code,
##      it may be necessary to inline some functions (typically, specialized
##      comparison functions such as cob_cmp_s32 which can be replaced by the
##      general comparison function cob_cmp_int);
## 3. For more convenience, if the generated program is prog.c, inline the
##    headers by replacing #include "prog.c.h" and #include "prog.c.l.h"
##    by the content of the files prog.c.h and prog.c.l.h respectively;
## 4. Although not mandatory, it is wiser to polish the code by removing
##    useless headers or portions of code.


# Note: contents from 3.x dropped as this only starts
#       to be relevant after the first 4.0 release
