We are grateful for the work of the Translation Project, its translation teams
and their individual contributors, who provide translations of user messages
for non-English speakers.

Similar thanks go to all the packagers who allow users to install GnuCOBOL from
their distributions' package management systems.

Also to the many people that have helped with testing this software.
We hope that everyone will continue to provide feedback. This is invaluable
to the ongoing development process.

A special mention here goes to people who have given exceptional support in
terms of time and resources on hardware that was not available to the
developers:
Oleg Philon     - For his work on the PowerPC
David Wilson    - For his work on the MAC (Darwin)
Sergey Kashyrin - For his work on:
  - SUN Solaris
  - IBM AIX
  - HP-UX

And continuing this amazing support:
Arnold Trembley <arnold.trembley@att.net> - Win32 packaging and user support
Chuck Haatvedt <chuck.haatvedt@gmail.com> - Work on optimized BCD handling
Ludwin Janvier <lud.janvier@gmail.com> - patches for build/packaging issues
Hans-Martin Rasch - Work on compiler syntax
Michel Gouget - Work on syntax - IS
Bill Klein - The mainstay for COBOL questions
Frank Swarbrick - Work on compiler syntax
Warren Gay - For testing systems we didn't even know we supported!
   (e.g. old DEC Alpha systems)
Fabrizio Calabretta - Work on the internal EXTFH interface

Gary L. Cutler <cutlergl@gmail.com> and Vincent B. Coen <vbcoen@gmail.com> for
writing and maintaining the GnuCOBOL Programmer's Guide.

OCamlPro SAS for assigning David Declerck, Nicolas Berthier and
Fabrice Le Fessant to work for adding GCOS (Bull) support and
contributing the result.

Denis Hugonnard-Roche for continuous additions to the internal test suite to
improve code coverage.
