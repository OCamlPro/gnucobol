We are thankful for the work of the Translation Project, their translation
teams and their one-time contributors, providing the translation of user
messages for non-English speakers.

Also to the many people that have helped out in testing this software.
We hope that everybody will continue to provide feedback. This is invaluable
to the continuing development process.

A special mention here of people who have provided exceptional support in terms
of time and resources on hardware that was not available to the developers:
Oleg Philon - For his work on the PowerPC
David Wilson - For his work on the MAC (Darwin)
Sergey Kashyrin - For his work on:
  - SUN Solaris
  - IBM AIX
  - HP-UX

And continuing this amazing support:
Ludwin Janvier <lud.janvier@gmail.com> - patches for build/packaging issues
Hans-Martin Rasch - Work on compiler syntax
Michel Gouget - Work on syntax - IS
Bill Klein - The mainstay for COBOL questions
Frank Swarbrick - Work on compiler syntax
Warren Gay - For testing systems that we didn't known that we even support!
   (eg. old DEC Alpha systems)
Fabrizio Calabretta - Work on the internal EXTFH interface

OCamlPro SAS for assigning David Declerck, Nicolas Berthier and
Fabrice Le Fessant to work for adding GCOS (Bull) support and
contributing the result.
