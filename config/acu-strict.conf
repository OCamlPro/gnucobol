# Default assign type
# Value: 'dynamic', 'external'

# If yes, file names are resolved at run time using

# For example, given ASSIGN TO "DATAFILE", the file name will be

#  3. the value of environment variable 'DATAFILE' or
#  4. the literal "DATAFILE"
# If no, the value of the assign clause is the file name.

# If yes, DISPLAY SPACES acts as ERASE EOS, DISPLAY X"01" acts as ERASE EOL,
