# NOTES on the usage:
#  This is an include-only compiler configuration file.
#  The following steps are applied when using this:
#  1: include "strict" syntax, setting behaviour-specific atrributes
#  2: include this file to allow features that the original
#     compilers don't support (larger lengths, syntax variations,...)
#  3: include the reserved-words list to *additional* set the
#     compiler-specific words to the default list


# Value: int

# Special option used here: "adjust" --> if the previous set option
# is more strict: override, otherwise leave it as it is
