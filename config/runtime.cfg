## General instructions
#

# The initial runtime.cfg file is found in the  $COB_CONFIG_DIR  ,
# which defaults to  installdir/gnucobol/config  (see  cobcrun --info  for the
# local path that is configured).
# The environment variable  COB_RUNTIME_CONFIG  may define a different runtime
# configuration file to read.

# If settings are included in the runtime environment file multiple times
# then the last setting value is used, no warning occurs.

# Settings via environment variables always take precedence over settings
# that are given in runtime configuration files. And the environment is
# checked after completing processing of the runtime configuration file(s)

# All values set to string variables or environment variables are checked
# for  ${envvar}  and replacement is done at the time of the setting.
# You can also specify a default value for the case that envvar is not set:
#   ${envvar:default}  (the format  ${envvar:-default}  is supported, too).

# Any environment variable may be set with the directive  setenv  .
# Example:  setenv COB_LIBARAY_PATH ${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}

# Any environment variable may be unset with the directive  unsetenv
# (one var per line).
# Example:  unsetenv COB_LIBRARY_PATH

# Runtime configuration files can include other files with the
# directive  include  .
# Example:  include my-runtime-configuration-file

# To include another configuration file only if it is present use the
# directive  includeif  .
# You can also use  ${envvar}  inside this.
# Example:  includeif ${HOME}/mygc.cfg

# If you want to reset a parameter to its default value use
#   reset parametername  .

# Most runtime variables have boolean values, some are switches, some have
# string values, integer values (if not explicit noted: unsigned) and some
# are size values.
# The boolean values will be evaluated as following:
# 	to true:	  1, Y, ON, YES, TRUE  (no matter of case)
# 	to false:	  0, N, OFF
# A 'size' value is an unsigned integer optionally followed by K, M, or G
# for kilo, mega or giga.

# Variables of type string can be of three different kinds:
# regular string, file name, and path list
# All those may contain the following escape sequences:
# 	$$	process id
# 	$f	executable filename (full path)
# 	$b	executable basename (anything after the last separator)
#	$d	date (yyyymmdd)
# 	$t	time (hhmmss)

# For convenience a parameter in the runtime.cfg file may be defined by using
# either the environment variable name or the parameter name.
# In most cases the environment variable name is the parameter name (in upper
# case) with the prefix  COB_  .

# For a complete list of the settings in use see  cobcrun --runtime-config  .

# Note:
# If you want to *slightly* speed up a program's startup time, remove all
# of the comments from the actual real configuration file that is processed.

## General environment
#

# Environment name:  COB_DISABLE_WARNINGS

#          Example:  DISABLE_WARNINGS  TRUE

# Environment name:  COB_ENV_MANGLE

#   Parameter name:  debugging_mode
#          Purpose:  to enable USE ON DEBUGGING procedures that were active
#                    during compile-time because of WITH DEBUGGING MODE,
#                    otherwise the code generated will be skipped
#             Type:  boolean
#          Default:  false
#          Example:  COB_SET_DEBUG  1

#          Example:  SET_TRACE  TRUE

# Environment name:  COB_TRACE_FILE
#   Parameter name:  trace_file
#          Purpose:  to define where COBOL trace output should go
#             Type:  string (file) ; may use $-sequences
#             Note:  file is opened for append if name starts with "+"
#          Default:  stderr
#          Example:  TRACE_FILE  ${HOME}/mytrace.$$

# Environment name:  COB_TRACE_FORMAT
#   Parameter name:  trace_format
#          Purpose:  to define format of COBOL trace output
#             Type:  string
#          Default:  "%P %S Line: %L"
#                    %P is replaced by Program-Id/Function-Id minimal length 29
#                       with prefix
#                    %I is replaced by Program-Id/Function-Id variable length,
#                       without prefix
#                    %L is replaced by Line number, right justified, length 6

# Environment name:  COB_TRACE_IO
#   Parameter name:  trace_io
#          Purpose:  define if I/O details should be added to trace
#             Type:  boolean
#          Default:  false
#          Example:  TRACE_IO true

# Environment name:  COB_CORE_ON_ERROR
#   Parameter name:  core_on_error
#          Purpose:  to enable operating system handling of signals and to
#                    raise an ABORT signal on runtime error instead of the
#                    default error handling, which will commonly kill the
#                    process after creating a coredump
#             Type:  0   means catching all default signals and do full
#                        internal error handling as done in versions pre 3.2
#                        along with full internal handling of COBOL runtime
#                        errors
#                    1   means to forward any signals; whatever happens
#                        by means of system signal handers will happen,
#                        which may include creating coredumps and killing
#                        the process before libcob does any cleanup; preserve
#                        full internal handling of COBOL runtime errors
#                    2   is identical to 1, but on runtime errors explicit
#                        raises SIGABRT after displaying it along with the  
#                        stacktrace and after doing minimal cleanup
#                    3   similar to 2, but instead of raising SIGABRT execute
#                        "gcore -a -o NAME $$" (where $$ is the process id and
#                        NAME is specified by COB_CORE_FILENAME) as early as
#                        possible before doing the normal internal error
#                        handling; if the command does not work or if a signal
#                        handler was executed before a SIGABRT is raised
#          Default:  0
#          Example:  core_on_error 3
#             Note:  If the operating system kills the process as part of the
#                    signal handling no COBOL centric dump will be created and
#                    no cleanup will be done either.
#                    When catching a signal (for example 11) it will be
#                    returned as exit code of the process, the generated
#                    coredumps store the reason for the error in the variable
#                    "runtime_err_str".

# Environment name:  COB_CORE_FILENAME
#   Parameter name:  core_filename
#          Purpose:  to adjust the default name or specify a folder for a

#                    may be disabled by setting it to "NONE"
#             Type:  string (file) ; may use $-sequences

# Environment name:  COB_PRE_LOAD
#   Parameter name:  pre_load
#          Purpose:  modules that are loaded during startup, can be used

#            Alias:  STRIP_TRAILING_SPACES  (0 = yes)
#             Type:  boolean
#          Default:  false
#             Note:  This setting is most useful if you want to REWRITE those

#             Type:  boolean
#          Default:  true (for MF files) otherwise false
#             Note:  The TRUE setting will insert a null character x"00" before

#                    validating that they only occur after a null character.
#                    Decreases LINE SEQUENTIAL performance and prevents writing
#                    escape sequences or formatting within the data.
#                    Only checked if COB_LS_VALIDATE is disabled.

#                    value of 8. Each TAB means to skip to the next column that
#                    is a multiple of 8
#                    Similar to Micro Focus INSERTTAB=ON option
