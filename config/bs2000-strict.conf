# Default assign type
# Value: 'dynamic', 'external'
assign-clause:			external

# If yes, file names are resolved at run time using
# environment variables.
# For example, given ASSIGN TO "DATAFILE", the file name will be
#  1. the value of environment variable 'DD_DATAFILE' or
#  2. the value of environment variable 'dd_DATAFILE' or
#  3. the value of environment variable 'DATAFILE' or
#  4. the literal "DATAFILE"
# If no, the value of the assign clause is the file name.

# If yes, NO ECHO/NO-ECHO/OFF is the same as SECURE (hiding input with
# asterisks, not spaces).
no-echo-means-secure:		no

# If yes, the first item in a field screen ACCEPT/DISPLAY (e.g. DISPLAY x UPON
# CRT) is located after the previous ACCEPT/DISPLAY (as though LINE 0 COL 0 had
# been specified).
line-col-zero-default:		no

# If yes, DISPLAY SPACES acts as ERASE EOS, DISPLAY X"01" acts as ERASE EOL,
# DISPLAY X"02" acts as BLANK SCREEEN and DISPLAY X"07" acts as BELL. Note
# DISPLAY LOW-VALUE is excluded from this; it will always just position the
# cursor.
