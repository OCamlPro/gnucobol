# If yes, file names are resolved at run time using

# For example, given ASSIGN TO "DATAFILE", the file name will be

#  3. the value of environment variable 'DATAFILE' or
#  4. the literal "DATAFILE"
# If no, the value of the assign clause is the file name.

no-echo-means-secure:		no

# If yes, the first item in a field screen ACCEPT/DISPLAY (e.g. DISPLAY x UPON
# CRT) is located after the previous ACCEPT/DISPLAY (as though LINE 0 COL 0 had
# been specified).
line-col-zero-default:		no

# If yes, DISPLAY SPACES acts as ERASE EOS, DISPLAY X"01" acts as ERASE EOL,
