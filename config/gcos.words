# Word list for dialect: GCOS 7 (Bull)

# NOTE: the mapping for COMP* usages does not exactly match the GCOS
# specification, due to the former missing some of the representations
# required.  The mapping below associates each COMP* with the closest
# representation currently available.
#
# In addition, the mapping for COMP-9 (32bit floating-point), COMP-10
# (64bit floating-point), and COMP-15 (128bit floating-point) may not
# use the correct representations (which should be FLOAT_BINARY_*) as
# at the moment their support is limited in cobc.
