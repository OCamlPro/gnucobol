# Word list for dialect: Micro Focus COBOL (current: Visual COBOL 6.0, MF21)

# Note: only used for strict dialect and when
#       requested by compiler directive >> IMP WORDS MF
#       the default reserved word list will not be used.

# Value: Word to make up reserved words list (case independent)
# All reserved entries listed will replace entire default reserved words list.
#   Words ending with * will be treated as context-sensitive words. This will be
# ignored if GnuCOBOL uses that word as a reserved word.
#   Entries of the form word-1=word-2 define word-1 as an alias for default
# reserved word word-2. No spaces are allowed around the equal sign.
