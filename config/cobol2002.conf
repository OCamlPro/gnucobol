# Default assign type
# Value: 'dynamic', 'external'
# Note: standard COBOL supports neither of them but has USING data-name for DYNAMIC
assign-clause:			external

# If yes, file names are resolved at run time using
# environment variables.
# For example, given ASSIGN TO "DATAFILE", the file name will be
#  1. the value of environment variable 'DD_DATAFILE' or
#  2. the value of environment variable 'dd_DATAFILE' or
#  3. the value of environment variable 'DATAFILE' or
#  4. the literal "DATAFILE"
# If no, the value of the assign clause is the file name.

# If yes, DISPLAY SPACES acts as ERASE EOS, DISPLAY X"01" acts as ERASE EOL,
