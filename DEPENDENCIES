============
Requirements
============

GnuCOBOL uses other software packages, some of these are necessary,
some optional. You find a detailed list of software "for the common
user" below.

  ***
    NOTE
    For all the following packages (required or optional),
    BOTH runtime AND development components are necessary.
  ***
  ***
    NOTE
    All the following packages are normally part of a Linux
    distribution. Cygwin distribution also has these as installable
    packages, other operating systems also may have repositories for
    these - eg. MAC OS, CentOS and others all have package repositories.
    ALWAYS install the distribution packages when available !!
  ***

GnuCOBOL REQUIRES one of the following external libraries to be installed
for implementation of decimal arithmetic:

    BOTH runtime AND development components required.

  o GNU MP (libgmp) 4.1.2 or later
    https://gmplib.org

  OR

  o MPIR (libgmp - MPIR gmp-compat) 1.3.1 or later
    (preferred when compiling on Windows with other compilers than GCC)
    http://mpir.org

    GNU MP and MPIR are distributed under GNU Lesser General Public License.

    NOTE
    Please ALWAYS use the distro package whenever possible !!
    See NOTE above.


GnuCOBOL MAY require the following external libraries to be installed:

    ***
    NOTE - libltdl is NOT needed when installing on Linux,
    SUN Solaris, MAC OS, CentOS or Windows
        (including Cygwin, MingW and native windows).
    It is also NOT needed with later versions of AIX and HP-UX.
    (AIX >= 5.1 and HP-UX >= 11.1 are known to NOT require this).
    (Check if you have the "dlopen" function).
    ***

  o GNU Libtool (libltdl)
    https://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/libtool.html

    libltdl is used to implement dynamic CALL statements.

    GNU Libtool is distributed under GNU Lesser General Public License.


The following libraries ARE required WHEN :

1) Indexed-Sequential file I/O (ISAM) is used

    BOTH runtime AND development components required.

    One of the following:

  o Berkeley DB (libdb) 4.1 or later
    https://www.oracle.com/
    https://www.oracle.com/technology/products/berkeley-db/db/index.html

    Berkeley DB is distributed under Oracles own open-source license.
    Note that if you linked your software with Berkeley DB,
    you must distribute the source code of your software along with your
    software, or you have to pay royalty to Oracle.

  o VBISAM - ISAM file handler (libvbisam) 2.0 or later
    https://sourceforge.net/projects/vbisam/

    VBISAM is distributed under GNU Lesser General Public License.

  o DISAM File handler (libdisam)
    http://www.isamcentral.com

    DISAM is distributed under the proprietary License
    "Byte Designs Ltd. DISAM Software License".

2) SCREEN SECTION and/or extended ACCEPT/DISPLAY is used

    BOTH runtime AND development components required.

    One of the following:

  o Ncurses (ncurses or ncursesw) 5.2 or later
    https://www.gnu.org/software/ncurses/ncurses.html

    Ncurses is distributed under a BSD style license.

  o PDCurses (pdcurses) for MinGW/native windows ports
    https://pdcurses.org/ or https://github.com/Bill-Gray/PDCursesMod/

    PDCurses is distributed as Public Domain.

  o Unix curses

3) XML runtime support is used

    BOTH runtime AND development components required.

    libxml2 - http://xmlsoft.org

    libxml2 is distributed under MIT License.

4) JSON runtime support is used

    BOTH runtime AND development components required.

    One of the following:

  o cJSON >= 1.3.0 - https://github.com/DaveGamble/cJSON
    Note: As an alternative of an installed version you may place
    cJSON.c and cJSON.h under "libcob" to include the used functions
    directly in the COBOL runtime.

    cJSON is distributed under MIT License.

  o JSON-C >= 0.12 - https://github.com/json-c/json-c

    JSON-C is distributed under Expat License.

5) charachter encoding support is needed and iconv is not provided
   as part of libc

    BOTH runtime AND development components required.

    libiconv - https://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv/

    GNU libiconv is distributed under GNU Lesser General Public License.

   Note: Support for partial character encoding is provided directly,
   full support for national and utf8 literals and data, as well as
   utf8 source encoding needs an implementation of the iconv API.


See HACKING if you wish to hack the GnuCOBOL source or build directly
from version control as this includes the list of additional tools
necessary for this task.
