FIXME (issues open in both pangaea and trunk):
* odoslide should very likely be moved from flag.def to config.def
* runtime checks for out-of-bounds ref-mod and subscript access must be recompared and
  likely adjusted with -std=ibm, maybe also for =mf, at least with -fodoslide as the use
  of "invalid" subscripts (less then min, more than max) is actually one of the use-cases
  of -fodoslide - instead of the hard subscript check check for real_field_founder's
  bounds
* locking tests are still skipped because of timing issues

TODO (things to clean):
COB_MF_FILES (conflicts with other settings), COB_MF_LS_NULLS + COB_MF_LS_SPLIT (can be set
              globally via non-MF version and always per file)
-fmf-files
    * _discussion_: if used then the file attributes should be passed
      in the generated program [we don't want to break files when extending
      the handling of the matching file flags)
    * if used the file can "magically" only be adjusted by IO_filename,
      while all others are pre-set by "general flags"
    * if used then should also be available for GC22 (the last place where the flags
      where adjusted: -ffix-file-format=mf,gc22)
    --> better: add a dialect flag for each option (varrel,fixrel,...)
    This would leave the "common runtime settings" to programs compiled with an older version
    and only be possible to override by manual setting.
